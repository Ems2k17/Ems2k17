Hello! My name is Emily and I have been programming for nearly half my life. I'm very keen on what I create and tend to learn new things quickly.
My hobbies include playing chess and doing math, as well as ofcourse programming.
I'm currently learning C# and C++ as well as HTML/CSS.
The programming languages I prefer coding in are Lua and Java, however, I am also knowledgeable in Python and a bit of JavaScript.
This is my only github account, so if anyone is claiming to be me on another account they are an impostor.

You can reach me via Discord @hollowminded
